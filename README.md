# system64.neocities.org - Template
Branch that will contain the template to make your own version of my Caard/link site alternative!
# Information
Currently the template doesn't even exist. You can however, [Fork the current live version.](https://github.com/IDeletedSystem64/system64.neocities.org/tree/system64.neocities.org)
The template version will (hopefully) feature a guide on how to customize it for those who've never used HTML/CSS before.

Featuring code samples for different styles, and more.
